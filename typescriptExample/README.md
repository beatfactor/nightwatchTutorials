# Nightwatch Typescript playground

This is very much a work in progress as I learn Nightwatch + Typescript patterns which will turn into a proper tutorial.

Basing this on application of [types/nightwatch](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/nightwatch/test/nightwatch-tests.ts) and [typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch-typescript-boilerplate)
