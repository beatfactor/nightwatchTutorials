# Nightwatch.js page objects and drop down select elements
This is the source code for the [Advanced Nightwatch.js testing using the Page Object and Command API](https://youtu.be/gJvAbGYP-H8) tutorial on the [reallyMello](https://www.youtube.com/c/reallymello) YouTube channel.

This code contains a sample calculator application with 3 drop downs for selecting 2 numeric inputs and a math operation to perform on them which outputs the result.

The test cases automate testing this user interface using Nightwatch.js

See [davidmello.com/nightwatch-page-object-model-with-commands/](https://www.davidmello.com/nightwatch-page-object-model-with-commands/) for the full tutorial.
