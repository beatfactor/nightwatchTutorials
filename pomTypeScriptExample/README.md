Examples for the NightwatchJS tutorials on the [reallyMello YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/reallyMello)

This code pairs with the article [Using TypeScript to write Nightwatch.js Automated Tests](https://www.davidmello.com/using-nightwatch-with-typescript/)

it converts the original example in [/pomExample](https://github.com/reallymello/nightwatchTutorials/tree/master/pomExample) which was written in JavaScript to TypeScript so you can look between the two to see the differences.
